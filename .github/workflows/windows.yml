      # Limit pip install to a basic install *without* full dependencies.
      # Here is why:
      #   * Windows is the slowest CI build, this speeds up testing by about
      #     3 minutes
      #   * Other CI tests on other (faster) OS's full dependencies and
      #     we needs some CI that tests running when packages aren't available
      # So "dev" only below, not "dev,full".
